# Project_genomeanalysis

This GitHub page contains an analysis of the data from the article Multi-omics reveal the lifestyle of the acidophilic, mineral-oxidizing model species
Leptospirillum ferriphilumT.  

The main analyses included in this study are:
● De novo assembly of long reads obtained using PacBio sequencing.
● Transcriptomics and differential expression analyses of L. ferriphilum grown in
continuous cultures with ferrous iron and in bioleaching cultures containing
chalcopyrite, an abundant ferric mineral found in biomining environments.

Almost all work is done in slurm and some analysis is done through R. 

On this first page, all the code used in this project is uploaded and on the wiki
an anlysis, a project plan and a conclusion of the project is written.
